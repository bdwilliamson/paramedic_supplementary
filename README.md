## Supplementary materials for the `paramedic` paper

This repository contains code to reproduce the analyses in "Estimation of microbial abundances from 16s data and qPCR abundances" by Williamson, Willis, and Hughes. All analyses were implemented in the freely available R programming language.

This README file provides an overview of the code available in the repository.

## Code directory

We have separated our code further into two sub-directories based on the two main objectives of the manuscript:

1. Numerical experiments to evaluate the operating characteristics of our proposed method under varying data-generating mechanisms.
2. An analysis of 433 taxa sampled from the vaginal microbiome of 1213 women.
